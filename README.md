## Project Overview

### General Description 📙

This project is focused on analyzing HR data collected during a survey about its respondents skills, shared within the context of **Wrocław AI Team** - an initiative designed to facilitate the execution of *AI, Data Science, and Business Intelligence (BI)* projects. The primary goal of this project is to create a practical learning opportunity, where individuals with shared interests collaborate and learn from each other.

### Objectives 🎯

The main objective is aimed at improving team management by utilizing data on the declared skills and competencies of individuals willing to participate in projects related to *Data Science / BI / Data Analytics* topics. By analyzing survey responses and clustering respondents based on their skills, the project aims to provide valuable insights that will help project founders form effective teams.

It also focuses on enhancing team management by leveraging data on declared skills and competencies of individuals eager to participate in AI, Data Science, and Business Intelligence (BI) projects. By analyzing survey responses and clustering respondents based on their skills, we aim to provide valuable insights that assist project founders in forming effective teams.

A significant objective is to develop participants' skills in using tools such as GitHub, VS Code, and programming in Python. Additionally, the project aims to teach essential Data Science skills.

### Methodology 📚

To achieve the project's objectives, we will employ various data analysis and clustering techniques, which are essential in extracting valuable insights from the dataset.
We will start with exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics and visualisation techniques.

We'll employ clustering algorithms to determine the most appropriate method for segmenting the dataset.

In order to achieve desired insights from the data provided, we decided to use:
- **Python 🐍** as the primary programming language for data analysis and clustering,
- **Pandas 🐼🐼** - for data manipulation and analysis,
- **NumPy 🔢** - for numerical operations,
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn 📈📊** - for data visualization,
- **Scikit-learn 🔬** - for implementing clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics,
- **VS Code 👨🏻‍💻** - code development and version control integration.

The dataset contains survey responses from individuals about their skills and competencies. It includes the following key columns:
- `Programming: Python, R, SQL`
- `Data Science: Machine learning / NLP / AI`
- `Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP`
- `BI tools`
- `Domain expertise` (e.g., FinTech, HealthTech, FashionTech, etc.)

As a part of analysis, we want to check or implement such parts like:

### Descriptive statistics 📝

**Summary statistics** - Calculating basic statistics for each skill category to understand the overall distribution of skills.

**Frequency distribution** - Determine the frequency of each skill level across all respondents to identify the most common skill levels.
### Correlation analysis *️⃣

**Skill correlation** - Analyze the correlation between different skills to identify patterns and relationships.

### Clustering analysis ✨
**k-means clustering** - Grouping respondents into clusters based on their skill sets to identify distinct profiles or archetypes within the data.

**Hierarchical clustering** - Using hierarchical clustering to visualize how respondents can be grouped based on skill similarities.

**Regression modelling** - 

### HR Benefits 👥

This approach is not only beneficial for team formation but also offers advantages for Human Resources (HR) departments. It provides a data-driven method to understand the skill distribution within the organization, improving recruitment processes, talent management, and personal development strategies.

By identifying distinct groups within the community, the project aims to improve decision-making in team formation, ensuring that each team has the right mix of skills and competencies to tackle real-world business challenges.
